Make shared library of graph utilities for coopnet and ai_master.



Where are we going?

A bunch of Entities operate on a network.
Each Entity has a local space of nodes it cares about and can influence.
An Entity wants to optimize a Function over its Jurisdiction.
The Function has optimal solutions when cooperatively solved.
The Entities have some avenue for communication.
Communication desire is not programmed in.



PROBLEM: Boolean Satisfiability

Entities own nodes (booleans).
Can see connections to hyperedges (clauses, bipartite graph).
Knows own node values, does not know other entities' node values.
Take turns updating nodes.
Can tell partial information (clause failed => know what all nodes are)
We can look at solveable and unsolveable satisfiability problems.
We can animate red/blue nodes in gephi.
We can retry problems many times and look at quick solutions.
See "Network Problem Layout.png".
Research terms: "cooperative boolean satisfiability", "cooperative belief propagation",
 "sudoku algorithms", "SAT/3-SAT algorithms", "magic square (?) algorithms",
 "rubix cube pattern (how changes affect multiple parts)"
If don't take turns, could be an interesting two-general problem, especially with many entities
 and small jurisdictions.

Questions:
Can we see strategies based around amount of uncertainty?
Can we see empathy/cooperation? Can we see strategies to not confuse others?
Belief propagation?
Do strategies scale with network size? Number of entities?
Should we look at giving internal optimization functions as well as shared (internal clauses)?
How do we store decisions, knowledge of other Entities?
How do we reinforce decisions? Do we reinforce dynamically?
