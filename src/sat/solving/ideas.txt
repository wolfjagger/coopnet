Several ways we can do this.

First, we can do traditional complete algorithms, like DPLL, without
 bothering too much with visitors and such. Need a way to store
 custom structures like partial assignments, need to store history,
 still have a lot of choice like how to pick new literals.

We can also use incomplete algorithms. Not sure about these yet.

We can do visitor searches. breadth_first, depth_first searches
 could do some interesting things. But we might need to make our
 own search algorithm as well as visitors to really get good results.

===DPLL===

Recursive DPLL(F,p)
Input : A CNF formula F and an initially empty partial assignment p
Output : UNSAT, or an assignment satisfying F
 begin
  (F,p) <- UnitPropagate(F,p)
  if F contains the empty clause then return UNSAT
  if F has no clauses left then
   Output p
   return SAT
  x <- a literal not assigned by p // the branching step
  if DPLL-recursive(F|-x, p || {-x}) = SAT then return SAT
  return DPLL-recursive(F|-x, p || {-x})
 end
  
sub UnitPropagate(F,p)
 begin
  while F contains no empty clause but has a unit clause u do
   F <- F|u
   p <- p || {u}
  return (F,p)
 end

Consider adding unit propagation (above), pure literal elimination,
 watched literals, clause learning, conflict-driven backjumping,
 randomized restarts, etc.


===Tracer(custom)===

tracer_visitor:

 Forward: Visitor goes through edges and verts until no more verts (=>SAT)
  examine_edge:
   if(!is_set(node))
    pick_literal(node)
   else if(sgn(edge) == sgn(node))
    set_done(clause)
  finish_vertex<clause>:
   if(!is_done(clause))
    backtrack();
  finish_vertex<node>:
   if(!is_set(node))
    pick_literal(node)
	set_done(node)

 Backward: Go back through queue of completed verts, unsetting edges/verts
           until beginning (=>UNSAT)
  uncolor(item)
  if(item == clause)
   set_undone(clause)
  if(item == node)
   if(!is_done(node))
    flip_literal(node)
	set_done(node)
	forward()

tracer_search: Model the search mostly after breadth_first,
               with a few key changes for speed.
