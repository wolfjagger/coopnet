If you want to build boost from source, there are several helpful descriptions online
 and in the html in the source. The gist is this:

NOTE: For some reason, building from source doesn't work (symlinks?). For now, don't build from source.


FROM SOURCE


Clone boost repo.

Use an appropriate terminal (terminal/cygwin for gcc, VS2015 command prompt for msvc).

Go to boost directory.
(See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2629421/how-to-use-boost-in-visual-studio-2010 for detail)

Run bootstrap (.sh if linux, .bat if windows).

Run b2 (can apply extra options, maybe --toolset=msvc-10.0 --build-type=complete architecture=x86 address-model=64 stage).

Add "/path/to/root/boost/directory" to include directories.

Add "/path/to/root/boost/directory/stage/lib" to linker library directories.


FROM BINARIES


To build otherwise, grab boost executables from jjdev:/big_data/shared/ and install them.

Alternatively, grab 14.0 from https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/
boost should be installed as "boost" in the same directory as coopnet.

Copy boost.vcxproj from coopnet/util to boost/boost.
