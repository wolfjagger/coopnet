If you want to build boost from source, there are several helpful descriptions online
 and in the html in the source. The gist is this:

Clone boost repo.
Use an appropriate terminal (terminal/cygwin for gcc, VS2015 command prompt for msvc).
Go to boost directory.
(See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2629421/how-to-use-boost-in-visual-studio-2010 for detail)
Run bootstrap (.sh if linux, .bat if windows).
Run b2 (can apply extra options, maybe --toolset=msvc-10.0 --build-type=complete architecture=x86 address-model=64 stage).
Add "/path/to/root/boost/directory" to include directories.
Add "/path/to/root/boost/directory/stage/lib" to linker library directories.

NOTE: For some reason, the above doesn't work. For now, don't build from source.



To build otherwise, grab boost executables from jjdev:/big_data/shared/ and install them.
 Alternatively, grab 14.0 from 
 boost should be installed as "boost" in the same directory as coopnet.
 Right now, boost project file isn't there, but could make one soon.
