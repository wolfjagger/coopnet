First, make sure the rapidcheck subrepo is initialized.

cd into coopnet/rapidcheck
mkdir build

Now using VS2015 command prompt, cd into coopnet/rapidcheck/build.
cmake -G "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64" ..

This will create the rapidcheck project to build in the coopnet sln.

Note that this project will build x64 rapidcheck only; remove
 the Win64 to build x86 version.
